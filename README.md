# DirtyCMS
This is a CMS?

## What is DirtyCMS?

DirtyCMS is not a good software engineering example. It is a **eficiency** and **simplicity** example.

It was designed to be simply, powerful and fit in a single file.

## How to install

Just copy the DirtyCMS folder to your webroot folder and access **backend.php**.

## Structure

DirtyCMS has just few files:

* **backend.php** - main back-end file
* **db.sqlite** - database file
* **frontend.php** - basic functions to query data in front-end interface
* **index.php** - example file
* **uploads/** - uploads directory
* **.htaccess** - some basic Apache configs

## Changing configs

It is strongly recommended move the **database file** out of the public folder of your web server. 

Change this and other settings on backend.php and frontend.php.
